    \section{Introduction}

    \newpage

    \section{Requirements}
    \subsection{Main Target Groups}
    Before pointing out goals, target groups and requirements of our project is useful to consider which stakeholders are involved:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item House owner
        \item Energy aware people
        \item Climate change concerned people
        \item Edison researchers
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Context and Needs}
    The context of our project is a smart mirror with a vocal assistant that helps you in energy saving % where such needs emerge (and where your solution will be used)

    %Please notice that NEEDS are properties of the stakeholders/end users, while GOALS are properties of your technological system, i.e., describe what you want to achieve, but not HOW
    % (“how” is described in the UX design section and, al a lower level of abstraction, in the
    % Implementation section). Goals are at a lower level of abstraction than Needs and more
    % concrete/specific.


    The needs are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[N1] Save on energy related costs
        \item[N2] Acquire energy consumption and production data
        \item[N3] Reduce waste of energy
        \item[N4] Study costumers'habits
        \item[N5] Provide to users energy saving related functionalities
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Goals}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[G1] Inform user about energy consumption/production in accessible and intuitive way
        \item[G2] Give feedback on most energy efficient ways to use home devices
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[C1] Mirror dimensions and components equipment (microphone, speaker, touchscreen)
        \item[C2] Data sources: smart plugs, smart devices
        \item[C3] Limited amount of time the user spend in front of the mirror
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Solution - UX Design}
    \subsection{General Approach}
    From the beginning of our work we thought about how to make the user interact with the mirror, because in our opinion if a user is not stimulated from the system will hardly interact with it, but we consider also the opposite scenario, if the mirror produce too many notification and stimuli from it the user can consider to turn it off to not to be disturbed.

    We design the mirror by always considering these characteristics, so we chose to have a passive interaction with the user by using appealing and captivating images.

    We have 3 main ways to interact:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Leafy status: the health status of Leafy, the mirror mascotte and vocal agent avatar, capture the attention of the user
        \item Yesterday \textit{Offender} and \textit{Good Boy}: the funny aspect of the appliances can bring the user to interact with the mirror to know more about them
        \item Daily mission and Reward System: a daily mission engage the user and make it
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Interaction and Interfaces}
    \subsection{Scenarios}

    %     - Suggestion for conversational interaction projects: include (examples of) dialogue diagrams that highlight how the conversation unfolds

    \subsection{Procedure}
    \newpage

    \section{Value proposition/Onliness statement}
% Concisely formulate which value you promise to your users/customers and what makes your
% “product” special or unique for them
% - Why is this a «good» solution?
% - Are there competitors? If yes, why is your solution better than the existing ones?
    \newpage

    \section{Future Works}
    %     - A critical reflection on your work (challenges, critical aspects, main difficulties
    % encountered…) and on the real potential of the technology you have developed to address
    % the needs of your target group and maybe of other targets…
    % - What was left out and future directions (what could be done next in the short - medium
    % term, visions in the long term…)
    \newpage

    \section{Member contribution}
    Member Contribution (IMPORTANT!): a table where you declare the main role and contribution
    that each group member has provided to the project; the table has the following structure:
    Member-Name-Surname; Main Role/Contribution. Role/Contribution is described in 2-3 lines
